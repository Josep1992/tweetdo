# PYDO or Tweetdo
    This is another todo ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but ... im learning how to work with @flask and python ‚ûï how to structure @apis
    Flask - Docker - Vanilla JavaScript - (maybe will move to NEXT.JS with Chakra UI) --- have to fix docker and create the real client
    @index.html was just for doing CRUD on @todos when it did not have user @auth

    Todo App with twitter api for tweeting completed todos if user sign's in with twitter
    Have to implement twitter functionality - for tweeting completed todos
    MAYBE will call it Tweetdo üòï
